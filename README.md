# Introduction
I discovered [https://albertlauncher.github.io/](Albert) and was blown away by how snappy and crucially useful it was. I was even more excited when I discovered the python extension, allowing users to write their own scripts - so I decided to compile mine all here.

## Installation
Largly the same of each extension.

Clone or download each folder and place, individually, in Python extension for Albert Launcher.

The easiest way to access this folder is to open Albert pyton extsion list in the settings and double clicking on any item (you may have to navigate up one directoy layer).

It will then appear, and can be enabled in the menu mentioned above

## Usage
Launch Albert (Normally Super+Space)

Type the trigger

Then type a query

Find more info in the README file in each folder
## Pull requests welcome
